A (for now) Command Line Interface program to calculate mortgage cost based on four factors:
* Credit Score
* Loan Amount
* Number of Years Financed
* Interest Rate

It then performs some basic math combining these figures and providing the result assuming that down payment based on credit score would be 10% at 750 or above, 20% between 650 and 750, etc.  If these numbers are inaccurate or if you want to change anything, please feel free. :)
